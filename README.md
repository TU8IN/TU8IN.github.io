My name is Tuhin Shaikh. I'm currently studying in LAET and have recently got into one of the UK's most well-known fintech companies, Dojo. 
What you should know about me is that I thrive in a team, and I'm determined to succeed.

One of the reasons why I want to become a software developer is my interest in Computer Science and Mathematics.
Plus, winning the Dojo Real Work challenge made me realise that I have the potential to get into fintech.
